# Digital Factory (Industry 4.0) - Testbed

The project will test out new Industry 4.0 features to create open and standardized automation solutions, with special attention on the digital twin using Asset Administration Shell (AAS). 

The main application domain for this project is the plant Industrial Automation Control System (IACS), also referred to as the Safety and Automation System (SAS).

To succeed with the digital factory, remote operation, and autonomy, it is necessary to move away from end-user and vendor-specific requirements, propriety solutions and closed architectures. There is a need to adopt open architectures, standardized data models and solutions in order to progress interoperability and facilitate easy upgrades and replacements of components.

The purpose of this project is to test and document how and why we shall go in the direction of adopting open international standards and protocols within the framework of Industrie 4.0/ Asset Administration Shell,  NAMUR Open Architecture (NOA), Module Type Package (MTP).

The project will identify the specifications and procedures needed to benefit from these new concepts and challenge them by testing in realistic environments. Approved solutions must be easy to access and adopt. They should not lock the end-user into a particular vendor or group, nor lock the end-user into formats and protocols that themselves are not open standards.
